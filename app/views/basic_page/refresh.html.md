# 2026 Refresh

Hey there! 

I know its been awhile. The best intentions of refreshing this place got lost in the relentless 
speed of life lately. 

Things are starting to slow down, and I'm making more time for this space. For now, you've got this
to look at. Kind of weird, huh?

Anyways, I'll be back soon with some stylistic refreshes to the site as well as some new thoughts
on tech, art, life, and whatever else comes up.
